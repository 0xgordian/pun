# Pun — Audit & Improvements Log

**Date:** April 2026  
**Scope:** Full codebase audit + implementation of all identified fixes

---

## What Was Audited

Full sweep of all 152 files in the codebase covering:
- All 5 API routes
- All 15 service files
- All 30+ components
- All test files
- CI/CD config
- Security, accessibility, observability

---

## Changes Made

### 1. aomi Proxy — Wallet Position Injection (`app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`)

**Problem:** The proxy read `x-wallet-address` header and `?wallet=` query param but never used them. The AI never saw the user's open positions.

**Fix:**
- Restored `fetchPriceChange`, `getTokenId`, `EnrichedMarket` — these were a half-finished CLOB enrichment feature, not dead code. The top 3 markets by volume now get 7d/30d price history fetched in parallel and injected into the AI context.
- Added `fetchPositionContext(origin, walletAddress)` — fetches open positions from `/api/positions`, formats them as a readable block, caches per-wallet for 30s.
- `fetchLiveMarketContext` now appends position context when wallet address is present.
- The AI now receives: top 10 markets by volume with 24h/7d/30d changes + user's open positions on every message.

---

### 2. aomi Proxy — Cold Start Warning

**Problem:** In-memory rate limit map resets on every serverless cold start with no warning.

**Fix:** Added `console.warn` on module load in production pointing to Upstash Redis migration guide.

---

### 3. CLOB Proxy — Rate Limiting + Body Size Guard (`app/api/clob/[...path]/route.ts`)

**Problem:** No rate limiting, no request body size limit.

**Fix:**
- Added 60/min per-IP rate limiting (same pattern as aomi proxy).
- Added 20k character body size guard returning 413.
- Added cold start warning.

---

### 4. Markets Search Route — Rate Limiting (`app/api/markets/search/route.ts`)

**Problem:** No rate limiting unlike the other API routes.

**Fix:** Added 60/min per-IP rate limiting.

---

### 5. Duplicate System Prompt (`app/page.tsx`)

**Problem:** `SYSTEM_CONTEXT` in `AutoSendBridge` was a 60-line duplicate of `POLYMARKET_SYSTEM_PROMPT` injected server-side on every message — wasting token budget on every session start.

**Fix:** Replaced with a 2-line session-identification message. All trading rules, persona, and market data are injected server-side by the proxy.

---

### 6. Sentry Error Tracking (`lib/errorTracking.ts`, `sentry.*.config.ts`)

**Problem:** `@sentry/nextjs` was installed but never initialized. `captureError()` only logged to console.

**Fix:**
- Created `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`.
- `captureError()` now calls `Sentry.captureException()` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set.
- Requires: add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` to `.env.local`.

---

### 7. PostHog Analytics (`lib/posthog.ts`, `lib/analytics.ts`)

**Problem:** `posthog-node` was installed (server-side only) but the browser SDK was missing. `trackEvent()` only logged to console.

**Fix:**
- Installed `posthog-js@1.240.6` (browser SDK).
- Created `lib/posthog.ts` with lazy initialization.
- `trackEvent()` now calls `posthog.capture()` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is set.
- Requires: add `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` to `.env.local`.

---

### 8. ErrorBoundary → captureError (`components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`)

**Problem:** `componentDidCatch` called `console.error` but never forwarded to error tracking.

**Fix:** `componentDidCatch` now calls `captureError(error, { context: 'ErrorBoundary', componentStack })`.

---

### 9. Bankroll Input Validation (`app/execute/page.tsx`)

**Problem:** Zero, negative, or non-numeric bankroll input was silently ignored.

**Fix:** Added `bankrollError` state. `handleSaveBankroll` validates input and shows inline error message. Error clears on input change.

---

### 10. Global Alert Poller Timer Leak (`lib/services/globalAlertPoller.ts`)

**Problem:** `setInterval` was started but never stored or cleared — leaked on HMR restarts.

**Fix:**
- Interval ID stored in module-level variable.
- `stopGlobalAlertPoller()` exported and called in `AppProviders` cleanup.

---

### 11. pollOrderFill AbortController Leak (`app/execute/page.tsx`, `lib/services/orderFillService.ts`)

**Problem:** `AbortController` was created when an order was submitted but `.abort()` was never called on unmount. The service also didn't accept a signal.

**Fix:**
- `pollOrderFill` now accepts an optional `AbortSignal` as third argument.
- Internal `sleep()` is abortable — fires immediately when signal fires.
- Each `fetch` call passes the signal through.
- Execute page passes `pollRef.current.signal` and calls `pollRef.current.abort()` on unmount.

---

### 12. OrderBook ARIA Labels (`app/execute/page.tsx`, `components/OrderBook.tsx`)

**Problem:** Bid/ask sections used color alone to distinguish sides — no ARIA labels for screen readers.

**Fix:** Added `aria-label="Ask prices"` / `aria-label="Bid prices"` with `role="list"` on containers and `role="listitem"` on rows in both the execute page `OrderBookPanel` and the standalone `OrderBook` component.

---

### 13. Focus Ring Accessibility (`app/globals.css`)

**Problem:** `outline-none` suppressed browser focus rings with no replacement — keyboard navigation was invisible.

**Fix:** Added `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid #7c3aed; outline-offset: 2px; }` — shows brand orange ring for keyboard users, hidden for mouse users via `:focus:not(:focus-visible)`.

---

### 14. CSP — PostHog + Sentry Endpoints (`next.config.js`)

**Problem:** `connect-src` in the Content Security Policy didn't include PostHog or Sentry endpoints — those SDKs would have been blocked by the browser.

**Fix:** Added `https://app.posthog.com`, `https://*.sentry.io`, `https://o*.ingest.sentry.io` to `connect-src`.

---

### 15. Auto-Execute Position Guards (`lib/services/globalAlertPoller.ts`, `components/app-providers.tsx`)

**Problem:** `checkGuards()` returned triggered rules but the exit order was never submitted — it just showed an alert. The biggest feature gap.

**Fix:**
- Global poller now checks guards every 60s alongside alerts.
- When a guard triggers with wallet connected + CLOB token ID → calls `sendLiveOrder` → routes through aomi → Para signing.
- When no wallet → records a paper trade and fires a browser notification.
- Guard is deactivated after execution to prevent re-triggering every 60s.
- Added `WalletPollerSync` component in `AppProviders` that keeps the poller's wallet address in sync as the user connects/disconnects.
- Added `setPollerWalletAddress()` export for external wallet sync.

---

### 16. CI/CD Improvements (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Problem:** CI used `npm ci` without `--legacy-peer-deps` (would fail), no coverage reporting, no dependency vulnerability scanning.

**Fix:**
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` to all `npm ci` calls.
- Added `--coverage` flag to test run.
- Added `npm audit --audit-level=high` step (warn-only until existing vulns resolved).

---

### 17. CONTRIBUTING.md

**Problem:** No contributor guide existed.

**Fix:** Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering setup, commands, code style, design system rules, testing, env vars, and PR guidelines.

## Remaining Open Items

### Should Do (production quality)
- **Persistent rate limiting** — replace in-memory Maps with Upstash Redis / Vercel KV. Both proxies warn about this on cold start.
- **WebSocket price feed** — replace 15s/60s polling with Polymarket's live CLOB WebSocket.
- **E2E tests** — Playwright. Critical flows: paper trade, wallet connect, alert creation, market search.

### Nice to Have
- **Market detail page** `/market/[slug]` — full order book, price history, AI analysis per market.
- **Structured logging** — `pino-pretty` is installed but unused. Replace `console.warn/error` in services.
- **Zod validation** — `zod` is installed. Add schemas to API route bodies and upstream API responses.
- **Onboarding flow** — `OnboardingModal.tsx` exists, verify trigger fires correctly for new users.

### Requires External Setup
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — create project at sentry.io, add DSN to `.env.local`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` — create project at posthog.com, add key to `.env.local`

## Post-Audit Feature Additions

### 18. AI-Triggered UI Actions

**Files:** `components/RuntimeAgentBridge.tsx`, `components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx`, `lib/stores/appStore.ts`, `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`

The AI can now directly control the Pun UI. Previously the bridge infrastructure existed but the AI was never told about it — so it never used it.

**What was added:**
- System prompt now includes explicit instructions for 4 UI tools the AI can emit
- `AssistantMessage` in `thread.tsx` parses `ui_tool` JSON from every AI response (same reliable pattern as `trade_card`)
- `RuntimeAgentBridge` updated with dual-path parsing (system events + message text fallback)
- 3 new tools added to `appStore`: `set_guard`, `navigate_to_page`, plus existing `simulate_bet` and `set_alert` now actually fire

**AI tools available:**
- `simulate_bet` — opens trade simulation modal pre-filled
- `set_alert` — creates price alert in localStorage directly
- `set_guard` — creates stop-loss/take-profit rule directly
- `navigate_to_page` — navigates to `/trade`, `/markets`, `/portfolio`, `/execute`

**How it works:** AI includes a `ui_tool` JSON block at the end of its response → `AssistantMessage` parses it on render → dispatches to Zustand store → components react.

---

### 19. Slash Command Palette

**File:** `components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx`

Type `/` in the chat composer to open a command palette above the input. 10 commands available, keyboard navigable (↑↓ arrows, Enter to select, Escape to dismiss). Typing after `/` filters the list.

**Commands:**

| Command | Prompt sent to AI |
|---|---|
| `/trade` | Find best opportunity + open simulation |
| `/edge` | Score all markets, rank top 3 |
| `/movers` | Biggest 24h probability movers |
| `/analyze` | Deep dive on top market |
| `/positions` | Review open positions and P&L |
| `/alert` | Suggest and create a price alert |
| `/guard` | Suggest and create stop-loss/take-profit |
| `/simulate` | Find trade + open simulation pre-filled |
| `/execute` | Navigate to order terminal |
| `/portfolio` | Navigate to portfolio |

Both slash commands and natural language work — they both end at the same place: the AI responds with a `ui_tool` JSON block and the UI reacts automatically.

Placeholder text updated to "Ask anything or type / for commands..." so users discover it naturally.

---

## Security & Scalability Hardening (Post-Audit)

### 20. Wallet Address Validation — Prompt Injection Prevention

**Files:** `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`, `app/api/positions/route.ts`

Added `ETH_ADDRESS_RE = /^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$/` validation before any wallet address is used. Invalid addresses (scripts, oversized strings, prompt injection attempts) are rejected with 400. The aomi proxy now sanitizes the wallet param before injecting it into the AI system prompt.

---

### 21. Rate Limiting on /api/positions

**File:** `app/api/positions/route.ts`

Added 60/min per-IP rate limiting. Previously this endpoint had no rate limiting and could be used to enumerate any wallet's positions or DDoS Polymarket's Gamma API.

---

### 22. positionCache Max Size

**File:** `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`

Capped the per-wallet position cache at 500 entries. When the limit is reached, the oldest entry is evicted. Prevents unbounded memory growth at scale.

---

### 23. SYSTEM_CONTEXT Message Filter Fixed

**File:** `components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx`

Updated `SYSTEM_CONTEXT_PREFIX` from `'You are the AI assistant embedded in Pun'` to `'[Session init]'` to match the new shorter session init message. The system context message is now correctly hidden from the chat thread.

---

### 24. X-Frame-Options Unified

**File:** `next.config.js`

Changed `X-Frame-Options` from `SAMEORIGIN` to `DENY` to match `vercel.json`. Both files now consistently use `DENY` — the stricter value.

---

### 25. Internal URL Stripped from 502 Errors

**File:** `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`

Removed `upstream: upstreamUrl.toString()` from 502 error responses. Internal upstream URLs are no longer exposed to clients.

---

### 26. SSRF Protection on Upstream URL

**File:** `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`

Added allowlist validation on `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL`. Only `api.aomi.dev` and `aomi.dev` are accepted. Misconfigured or compromised env vars can no longer redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers.

---

### 27. Search Query Sanitization

**File:** `app/api/markets/search/route.ts`

Strips `&=?#%` characters from search queries and caps at 200 characters. Prevents parameter pollution attacks against the Gamma API.

---

### 28. Shared Rate Limiter with Upstash Redis

**Files:** `lib/ratelimit.ts`, all 5 API routes

Created `lib/ratelimit.ts` — a shared rate limiting module that uses Upstash Redis when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are configured, falls back to in-memory when not. All 5 API routes now use this shared limiter. Rate limits are now persistent across all Vercel serverless instances — bypassing by hitting different instances is no longer possible.

---

### 29. Rate Limit Map Cleanup Threshold Lowered

**Files:** All API routes

Lowered cleanup threshold from 1000 to 200 entries. Stale rate limit entries are evicted more aggressively, reducing memory pressure under high traffic.

---

### 30. PostHog Page View Tracking

**Files:** `components/PostHogProvider.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`

Created `PostHogPageView` component that tracks route changes using `usePathname` + `useSearchParams`. Added to root layout inside a `Suspense` boundary (required for App Router). PostHog now tracks page views on every navigation, not just initial load.

---

### 31. Bankroll Input on Mobile Execute Page

**File:** `app/execute/page.tsx`

Added a mobile-visible bankroll input panel (`flex sm:hidden`) above the market picker on the execute page. Mobile users can now set their bankroll without needing a desktop.

---

### 32. Markets Category Filter Bug Fixed

**File:** `app/markets/page.tsx`

Fixed two bugs:
1. `activeCategory` was missing from the `useMemo` dependency array — category clicks didn't re-filter markets
2. `MarketGrid.visibleCount` never reset on category switch — added `useEffect` to reset to 48 on markets prop change

---

### 33. Para Modal Theme — Icon Visibility

**Files:** `components/app-providers.tsx`, `components/ParaBackdrop.tsx`

Added `customPalette` to Para modal theme with explicit `text.primary`, `tileButton`, `iconGroup`, and `input` colours. Added `MutationObserver` in `ParaBackdrop` to inject shadow DOM CSS that forces SVG icon strokes to `#f0f0f0` whenever Para updates the DOM. Add Funds, Send, Withdraw, Profile icons are now white and visible.

---

### 34. Wallet Connect on All Pages (Mobile)

**Files:** `app/trade/page.tsx`, `app/markets/page.tsx`, `app/execute/page.tsx`, `app/portfolio/page.tsx`

All 5 pages now pass `onConnectWallet` and `onManageWallet` to `TopNav`. Mobile hamburger menu shows "Connect Wallet" button on every page when wallet is not connected. Wallet address in TopNav is now clickable and opens Para account management modal.

---

### 35. Observability Stack Activated

**Keys configured in `.env.local` and Vercel:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — Sentry error tracking (US region, high priority alerts)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` — PostHog analytics (page views, events)
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` — Upstash Redis (us-east-1, eviction enabled)
- `KV_REST_API_URL` + `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` — Vercel KV (shared cache, pending wire-up)

---

## Remaining Open Items

- Wire Vercel KV for shared market context cache across instances
- Add Vercel environment variables for production deployment (all 8 keys)
- E2E tests with Playwright
- WebSocket price feed (replace polling)

### 36. All 5 API Routes Migrated to Shared lib/ratelimit.ts

**Files:** `app/api/aomi/[...path]/route.ts`, `app/api/clob/[...path]/route.ts`, `app/api/markets/route.ts`

Previously aomi, CLOB, and markets routes had local in-memory rate limit implementations. All 3 now use `lib/ratelimit.ts` — the shared module that uses Upstash Redis when configured and falls back to in-memory. All 5 routes are now consistent.

---

### 37. KUROKO Logo — White, No MARKETS Suffix, All Screen Sizes

**File:** `components/TopNav.tsx`

Desktop logo was "KUROKO MARKETS" with orange "MARKETS" suffix. Mobile was "Pun" in orange. Both now show "KUROKO" in white (`#f0f0f0`) on all screen sizes.

---

### 38. Wallet Address Clickable — Opens Para Account Management

**File:** `components/TopNav.tsx`

Added `onManageWallet` prop to TopNav. When wallet is connected, the green address in the nav bar is now a clickable button. Clicking it calls `authAdapter.manageAccount()` which opens the Para modal for disconnect, account switching, etc. Works on both desktop and mobile.

---

### 39. Mobile Connect Wallet on All 5 Pages

**Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `app/trade/page.tsx`, `app/markets/page.tsx`, `app/portfolio/page.tsx`, `app/execute/page.tsx`

All 5 pages now pass `onConnectWallet` and `onManageWallet` to TopNav. The mobile hamburger menu shows a full-width "Connect Wallet" button at the bottom when wallet is not connected.

---

### 40. Wallet Address Injected into AI Proxy via ?wallet= Param

**File:** `app/page.tsx`

The `backendUrl` passed to `AomiFrame.Root` now appends `?wallet=<address>` when a wallet is connected. The aomi proxy reads this param, validates it with `ETH_ADDRESS_RE`, and calls `fetchPositionContext` to inject the user's open positions into the AI system prompt. The AI now actually sees the user's positions on every message.

---

### 41. Para Modal customPalette — Correct Nested Structure

**File:** `components/app-providers.tsx`

Fixed TypeScript error: `customPalette` was using flat string keys (`'text.primary'`, `'tileButton.background'`) which don't exist in the `CustomPalette` type. Replaced with correct nested object structure (`text: { primary: '#f0f0f0' }`, `tileButton: { surface: { default: '#1a1a1a' } }`, etc.).

---

### 42. ParaBackdrop — MutationObserver + Global Style + Aggressive Icon Injection

**File:** `components/ParaBackdrop.tsx`

Three-layer approach to force Para modal icons white:
1. Global `<style>` tag injected into `document.head` targeting `cpsl-auth-modal` host element
2. Shadow DOM CSS re-injected fresh on every tick (not cached) with `!important` rules on all SVG elements
3. MutationObserver watches shadow DOM with `attributes: true` to catch Para re-renders that reset inline styles
4. JS-based inline style injection forces `color: #f0f0f0` on all button containers and `stroke/fill: #f0f0f0` on all SVG paths

---

### 43. dev:clean Script Added

**File:** `package.json`

Added `"dev:clean": "rm -rf .next && next dev"` script. Clears the stale build cache before starting the dev server — fixes the `ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk app/layout failed` error that occurs after significant code changes.

---
