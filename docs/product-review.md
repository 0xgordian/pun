# Pun — Full Product Review

> A complete A-Z breakdown of what has been built, page by page, service by service, and why it matters.

---

## What This Is

A full-stack AI-powered prediction market trading terminal. Not a demo. Not a prototype. A real product with 5 pages, 15+ services, and a coherent architecture that combines real-time market data, intelligent edge detection, wallet-integrated trade execution, and automated risk management — all inside a brutalist terminal UI. Built in 3 days. Production-ready.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, TypeScript |
| AI | aomi-widget (embedded chat) + aomi-sdk Session (trade routing) |
| Wallet | Para SDK (Google, Twitter, Discord, email auth) |
| Markets | Polymarket Gamma API (live data) + CLOB proxy (order books) |
| Storage | localStorage (trades, alerts, guards, bankroll) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + inline styles (brutalist design system) |

---

## Design Principles

1. Paper-trade first — everything works without a wallet or API key
2. Live-ready — wallet + aomi API key enables real execution on Polygon
3. Stateless backend — proxy pattern for market data + system prompt injection
4. Terminal aesthetic — zero border-radius, monospace typography, orange accent #ff4500
5. Honest signals — no fabricated labels, only observable data

## Pages

### / — AI Chat

The core of the product. A full-screen AI assistant with live Polymarket data injected into every message.

What it does:
- Embedded AomiFrame chat interface with custom thread rendering
- System prompt injected once per session (survives navigation via sessionStorage)
- Every message enriched server-side with top 10 markets by volume, 24h/7d/30d probability changes, biggest movers, and user open positions if wallet connected
- ?q= URL param auto-sends a query on load — enables deep linking from other pages
- AI can return trade_card JSON which renders as an interactive confirmation card inline in chat
- shareToChat integration — trade confirmations flow back into the thread automatically
- Wallet status shown in TopNav: Signing Ready (connected) or Paper Mode (no wallet)

Data flow:
1. Markets load from /api/markets on mount
2. User sends message — proxy enriches with live context — aomi backend processes
3. AI responds with analysis or trade_card JSON
4. User confirms trade — sendLiveOrder or paper trade recorded
5. Result shared back to chat thread via shareToChat

### /trade — Market Dashboard

Where traders hunt for opportunities. 1000+ live markets scored and filtered.

What it does:
- Live market feed refreshed every 15s active / 60s idle
- Edge engine scores every market 0-100 on volume, liquidity, uncertainty, 24h movement
- Category filters: Elections, Crypto, Sports, Economics, Tech, World
- Natural language query bar — findEdges() filters and scores, returns top 3 opportunities
- Simulate Bet fetches real CLOB best-ask price before opening the modal
- AI widget embedded on right column, toggleable on desktop
- Position panel shows open positions if wallet connected
- Deep link support: /trade?simulate=MARKET_ID&side=YES&shares=50 auto-opens simulation modal

Layout:
- Desktop: 3-column (markets + trending + AI panel) or 2-column when AI closed
- Mobile: Tab-based (Markets, Trending, Analysis, AI)

Edge scoring algorithm:
- Volume: >$1M = 30pts, >$500K = 20pts, >$100K = 10pts, else 5pts
- Liquidity: >$100K = 20pts, >$50K = 12pts, >$10K = 6pts
- Uncertainty: near 50% = 30pts, within 20pp = 20pts, within 30pp = 10pts, else 5pts
- 24h movement: >10pp = 20pts, >5pp = 12pts, >2pp = 6pts
- Result: 0-100 score mapped to STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK

---

Order flow:
1. User selects market — fetches order book + analyzes signals
2. User enters shares + limit price — calculates cost/payout/return
3. User clicks Submit — sendLiveOrder() builds EIP-712 payload
4. aomi Session routes to wallet — user signs
5. Order submitted to CLOB — pollOrderFill() tracks status every 3s
6. Trade recorded to history

## PMF and Why This Matters

### The User

Active Polymarket traders. People who already know what prediction markets are, already have positions, and are frustrated by the native Polymarket UI — which is a market browser, not a trading tool. No edge detection. No AI analysis. No position guards. No order book signals. No slippage estimates.

### The Problem They Have Right Now

1. They cannot monitor 1000+ markets manually — they miss moves
2. They have no way to know if a market has good execution conditions before entering
3. They have no automated risk management — they watch positions manually
4. The AI tools they use (ChatGPT, etc.) do not have live Polymarket data

### Why This Solves It

- The edge engine surfaces the 3 best opportunities from 1000+ markets in seconds
- The signal engine tells you if the spread is too wide before you enter
- The position guard watches your positions 24/7 and alerts when thresholds cross
- The AI has live data injected — it actually knows what is happening right now
- Paper-trade mode means anyone can start immediately without a wallet

### Why Now

Polymarket volume hit $1B+ in 2024 and is growing. The 2026 midterms, Fed rate decisions, crypto price markets — there is more money and more markets than ever. But the tooling has not kept up. The traders who are winning are the ones with better information and faster execution. This is that tool.

### The Honest Gap

The position guard fires an alert but does not auto-execute yet. That is the next unlock — when the guard triggers, it routes the exit order through aomi automatically. That is the feature that makes this genuinely differentiated from anything else in the market.

## Future Roadmap — Expanding the Product Surface

### DeFi Layer (unlocks DeFi category)

Build a momentum rotation agent directly into Pun using the `aomi-client-example` pattern. The architecture already exists — aomi Session, EIP-712 signing, viem. The addition:

- A DeFi tab where the agent manages a risk/stable allocation on Uniswap or Curve
- User sets a rule: "rotate to stable if ETH drops 10% in 24h"
- The agent evaluates the signal every 60s using the same position guard loop already in `globalAlertPoller.ts`
- On trigger, routes the swap through aomi's DeFi plugin (Delta, Khalani, Molinar apps already in the SDK)
- User signs locally via Para — no custody, no API-key juggling

This is a 2-week build on top of existing infrastructure. The position guard service, the aomi Session pattern, and the polling loop are all already written. The only new work is the DeFi strategy logic and the UI tab.

**Why it matters:** Prediction market traders already think in probabilities and expected value. Extending that same mental model to DeFi yield and rotation strategies is a natural product expansion. The same user who sets a stop-loss on a Polymarket position would set a rotation rule on their ETH/USDC allocation.

---

### Social Trade Feed (unlocks Social category)

Add a public trade feed — when a user confirms a trade card, they can optionally broadcast it to a shared Pun feed.

- `shareToChat` already exists in `appStore.ts` — extend it to an optional public broadcast
- Each shared trade shows: market question, side, price, timestamp, wallet address (truncated)
- Other users see a live feed: "0x1a2b just bought YES on Fed rate cut at 44¢"
- Trades can be one-click copied into your own simulation modal
- Filter by category, side, or probability range

**Why it matters:** Every shared trade is a distribution moment. Prediction market traders follow each other's positions — this is how Polymarket's own leaderboard drives engagement. A social feed turns Pun from a solo tool into a community layer on top of Polymarket. It also creates a natural viral loop: traders share their wins, others discover the product.

**Implementation path:** Minimal backend required. A lightweight Vercel KV store (already configured in the environment) can hold the last 500 public trades. The feed polls every 30s. No authentication required to view — wallet connection required to post.

---

### Wallet Risk Layer — DD.xyz Integration (extends Security category)

Integrate Webacy's DD.xyz APIs to add a due diligence layer at key interaction points:

- **On wallet connect:** Call the Exposure Risk API, display a safety score in TopNav alongside the wallet address (LOW / MEDIUM / SAFE / SAFEST)
- **Before order execution:** Run the Transaction Risk API on the counterparty addresses in the order book before submitting to CLOB
- **On market load:** Flag markets whose underlying contracts have risk signals via the Contract Risk API

This directly addresses the gap between AI-assisted trading and safe trading. A user executing through an AI agent currently has zero visibility into the risk profile of the addresses they're interacting with. The DD.xyz layer closes that gap.

**Implementation:** 2-hour integration for the wallet connect flow. The Exposure Risk API call fires after Para SDK confirms connection, result stored in component state, displayed as a badge in TopNav. No new architecture required.

---

## Code Quality

### Strengths

- Consistent service layer abstraction
- Type-safe throughout (TypeScript)
- Deterministic algorithms (edge scoring, signal generation)
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks at every layer
- localStorage persistence with max record limits
- Responsive design (desktop and mobile)
- Error boundaries on all data panels
- Adaptive polling (15s active / 60s idle)
- 5-minute server-side market context cache

### Architecture Decisions

**Paper-trade first** — All features work without credentials. Graceful degradation: paper mode to signing required to executed.

**Server-side system prompt injection** — Backend proxy enriches every message with live market data. AI always has current context without visible message pollution in the thread.

**localStorage-based state** — No backend database required. Trades, alerts, guards, bankroll all stored locally. Scales to 200 trades per user. Survives page reloads and navigation.

**Deterministic edge scoring** — Observable signals only. No fabricated labels. Transparent breakdown shown to user.

**Honest signal engine** — Replaces old edge engine which fabricated signals. Every signal has a verifiable data source (spread bps, book depth, volume, 24h movement).

**Slippage estimation** — Walks order book, calculates volume-weighted average fill price vs best price. Shown in order form for transparency before the user commits.
