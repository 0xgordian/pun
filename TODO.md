### Bug Fixes
- [x] `setState` deprecated in aomi-labs/react — replaced with `setApiKey`
- [x] Model select stuck on "Loading..." — removed broken manual session bootstrap
- [x] AI chat auto-firing on navigation — backendUrl was changing every render (included trade history in URL), causing AomiFrame.Root to remount and re-fire AutoSendBridge
- [x] `postState` 404 error overlay in dev — patched console.error to suppress aomi non-fatal errors
- [x] Proxy upstream URL wrong — `https://aomi.dev` → `https://api.aomi.dev`
- [x] `useAomiAuthAdapter` polling — replaced 2s unconditional interval with event-driven approach
- [x] Para singleton — `signTypedData` and `sendTransaction` reuse cached ParaWebModule instance
- [x] `marketService.ts` module-level side effects — moved into `initMarketService()`
- [x] `AlertsPanel` notification toggle bug — state setter shadowed service function
- [x] `edgeEngine.ts` wrong `estimatedReturn` formula — matches BetSimulation now
- [x] `tradeIntentService.ts` dynamic imports on every trade — Session class cached
- [x] Error boundaries on data panels — PriceChart, AlertsPanel, TradeHistory wrapped
- [x] Execute page wallet not wired — `useAomiAuthAdapter` now called, wallet state passed to TopNav
- [x] Execute page paper trade gate — no wallet = paper trade directly, no sendLiveOrder call
- [x] Execute page signing — Para modal opens automatically when SIGNING_REQUIRED returned
